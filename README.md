## Prerequisites

Usually every project has its special guidelines for contributing. Always follow these guidelines.

## Forking the project

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.
2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.

## Create a branch

Start a new branch for your feature/change. Remember to follow the project's naming conventions for the feature branch.

## Make changes

## Run the tests

## Squash your commits

## Create a pull request

## Garden your branches

### Renaming your remote feature branch

An easy way to do this is the following:

1) Create a new branch(execute this from your old-branch)

`$ git branch new-branch origin/old-branch`

2) Push your branch with its brand new name to origin:

`$ git push origin --set-upstream new-branch`

3) Delete the old branch from origin and the local machine:

`$ git push origin :old-branch`
`$ git branch -D old-branch`
