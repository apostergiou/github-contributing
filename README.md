## Prerequisites

Usually every project has its special guidelines for contributing. Always follow these guidelines.
If your contribution is relatively big or a feature, first open an issue to discuss this and get approval. Then, start the feature development.

## Forking the project

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the repository.

2. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork.

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:apostergiou/github-contributing.git
  ```

## Create a branch

Start a new branch for your feature/change. Remember to follow the project's naming conventions for the feature branch.

```shell
git branch refactor-code # remember to respect repo naming conventions for branches
```

## Run the tests

Make sure your changes donâ€™t break the existing project. Test your changes with the existing suite and if possible add tests for your changes.

e.g. [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec):
  ```shell
  rspec
  ```
## Commit changes

Commit your changes. Follow the [git-stye-guide](https://github.com/agis-/git-style-guide#commits).

```shell
git commit -m "Refactor code"
```

## Squash commits

```shell
$ git fetch upstream
$ git checkout my-feature
$ git rebase -i upstream/master

# choose squash for all of your commits, except the first one
# Edit the commit message to make sense, and describe all your changes

$ git push origin my-feature -f
```

## Create a pull request

Once your commits are squashed into small logical changes, go ahead and open a pull request. Adding a comment describing your feature, will usually help the review process.

Simply push to origin and use the new pull request button.

```shell
git push origin refactor-code
```

### Renaming your remote feature branch

An easy way to do this is the following:

1) Create a new branch(execute this from your old-branch)

`git branch new-branch origin/old-branch`

2) Push your branch with its brand new name to origin:

`git push origin --set-upstream new-branch`

3) Delete the old branch from origin and the local machine:

`git push origin :old-branch`
`git branch -D old-branch`
